Final Project
This project is a Deck of Cards, and has various methods of shuffling and sorting. Download the file(s) in the repo (there is no text file included) and install them on your VM. Simply run project_driver.cpp in your terminal, and make sure project_file1.cpp and final_project.h are in the same directory. You should see a Menu for all the options on the program. You must press 1 to create the deck before pressing any other buttons. For your consideration, this code was written in Geany. Enjoy!
